TODO:
	remove event chaining system -
	replace map containers with vector -
	implement priorities -
	implement register event with options for emitting events serially by choice -
	implement setting affinity for emitting events on specified thread rather than
		random -
	implement automatic priority assigner based on maximum latency which
		gets specified when registering event -

explanation:
	remove event chaining system
	; this is unnecessary bloat and can slow down event system

	replace map containers with vector
	; using only one map to map from "event_name" to id inside vector is enough
